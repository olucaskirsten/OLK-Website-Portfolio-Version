LINK TO VIEW THE PROJECT ONLINE: https://olk-website-portfolio-version.vercel.app

A public, portfolio-ready version of the OLK Web & SEO website, built with static HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project presents a modern digital studio experience with multilingual content, animated sections, page transitions, particles, reusable components and anonymized portfolio case studies.

## Overview

This project was developed as a professional front-end portfolio piece. It showcases a complete static website structure for a web design and SEO studio, including institutional pages, services, portfolio projects, digital products and a contact page.

The public version keeps the OLK identity while removing sensitive client media, videos and private form endpoints. Real project visuals were replaced with abstract tech-style overlays so the code, layout and experience can be shared publicly in a portfolio repository.

## Multilingual System

The project uses a split translation structure:

```txt
js/lang-en.js
js/lang-pt.js
js/lang-es.js
js/i18n.js
```

The language engine reads the selected language from `localStorage` and applies translations to elements using:

```html
data-i18n="key.name"
data-i18n-html="key.name"
data-i18n-ph="key.name"
```

## Reusable Components

The project loads shared components using `js/include.js`:

```txt
components/header.html
components/footer.html
components/whatsapp.html
```

This avoids duplicating the header, footer and WhatsApp button across all pages.

## Local Usage

Because the project uses `fetch()` to load HTML components, it should be opened through a local server instead of directly opening the HTML file in the browser.

Using VS Code, install the Live Server extension and run the project from `index.html`.

Alternatively, use a simple local server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

or:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```txt
http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

This project can be deployed as a static website. It does not require a backend build process.

Recommended deployment flow:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. Keep the framework preset as static/other if asked.
4. Leave build command empty if Vercel detects it as a static project.
5. Deploy from the project root.
